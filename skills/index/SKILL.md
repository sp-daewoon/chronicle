name: index
description: Give your project one beautiful front door instead of scattered docs. Use when generating or refreshing a single navigation hub that links your ADRs, changelog and releases. Outputs Markdown or a self-contained HTML page based on your config, and adapts to any repo via config or auto-detection.

# Index Workflow

Generate a single entry-point index for the project.

## Generate

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/index-render.mjs"
```

This reads the configured `index.sources` (default: adr, changelog, releases), counts ADRs, checks for the changelog, and writes `index.output`. The format follows the output file extension — `.md` produces markdown, `.html` produces a self-contained page.

## Rules

- Re-run after adding ADRs, cutting releases, or restructuring docs.
- Configure `index.sources` and `index.output` in `chronicle.config.json` to control scope and format.
